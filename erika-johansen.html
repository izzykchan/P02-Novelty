          <h2>Erika Johansen</h2>
          <p class="para">Erika Johansen grew up and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. She went to Swarthmore College, earned an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and eventually became an attorney, but she never stopped writing. There is absolutely nothing about her online and this is the only bio I could find, so this is me blathering on and on so that her bio is filled out a little bit. I like her novels, as they feature strong a female protagonist with a big brain and lots of determination, and a really interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy.</p>
