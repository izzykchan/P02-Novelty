          <h2>Patrick Ness</h2>
          <p class="para"> I’m Patrick Ness. I claim three states in America as my home (as Americans are wont to do): I was born in Virginia, my first memories are Hawaiian, and I went to junior high and high school in Washington. Then I lived in California for college (at USC) and moved to the United Kingdom in 1999, where I’ve lived (mostly in London) ever since. Ness won the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians both in 2011 and in 2012, for Monsters of Men and A Monster Calls, recognising each as the best new book for children or young adults published in the UK[2][3][4][5][a] He is one of seven writers to win two Medals (no one has won three) and the second to win consecutively.</p>
          <p class="para">I love the Decemberists, Peter Carey and A&W Cream Soda. I dislike onions. Intensely.</p>
